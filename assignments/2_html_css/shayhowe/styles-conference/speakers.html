              <h2>Aaron Irizarry</h2>
              <h5>Designing a Culture of Design</h5>
  
              <p>Workplace culture doesn&#8217;t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn&#8217;t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It&#8217;s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it&#8217;s what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.</p>
  
              <p>In Aaron&#8217;s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that others don&#8217;t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace&#8217;s culture. Once you&#8217;ve worked within a culture of design it&#8217;s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</p>
  
              <h5>About Aaron</h5>
  
              <p>Aaron Irizarry is a Senior Product Designer for Nasdaq OMX, a lover of heavy metal, a foodie, and a master of BBQ arts.

              <h5>Lights! Camera! Interaction! Design Inspiration from Filmmakers</h5>
  
              <p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It&#8217;s the filmmaker&#8217;s job to put this together. To do so they&#8217;ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told story.</p>
  
              <p>With this workshop, we&#8217;ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We&#8217;ll look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We&#8217;ll consider why they&#8217;re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.</p>
  
              <h5>About Adam</h5>
  
              <p>Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration, communication, creativity and storytelling. As an Experience Design Director with Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ years of experience in interaction and experience design with a background in computer science, film, and animation to create effective and easy-to-use digital products and services. He believes that no matter how utilitarian a tool is, at the core of its creation lies a story; uncovering that story is key to its success. Occasionally, he shares his perspectives on design at <a href="http://adamconnor.com/">adamconnor.com</a> and <a href="http://www.discussingdesign.com/">discussingdesign.com</a>.</p>

            <h5>Death to Wireframes: Long Live Rapid Prototyping</h5>

            <p>Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes things a little better by allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is even better and faster; it increases collaboration and improves the iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.</p>

            <h5>What Designers and Strategists Can Learn from Dick Fosbury</h5>

            <p>Dick Fosbury is an American track and field athlete who challenged the conventional approach to the high jump with an unorthodox &#8220;back first&#8221; technique that became known as the Fosbury Flop. His innovative approach to a sport that seemed to have reached its limits was ridiculed at first, with sportswriters labeling him &#8220;the world&#8217;s laziest high jumper&#8221; &#8212; but today variations of the Fosbury Flop are used by almost every high jumper.</p>

            <p>We need to challenge conventions, too. Many of the design conventions used in web, mobile and device interfaces have evolved from systems and processes that no longer connect with our audiences&#8217; realities: a floppy disk as a metaphor to &#8220;save&#8221; information, push buttons as control devices and typography standards derived from mechanical typesetting.</p>

            <p>As designers and strategists, we need to think like Dick Fosbury, to deconstruct analogues, and to free ourselves from outdated ideas so that we can develop the new interfaces and interactions of the future.</p>

            <h5>About Brad</h5>

            <p>Brad Smith is executive director for WebVisions, a conference that explores the future of the web. Most recently he launched &#8220;The Institute for Social Good,&#8221; an organization that connects non-profits with volunteers willing to spend a day building awesome web and mobile apps to change the world for the better.</p>

            <h5>The Business of Play</h5>

            <p>Play isn&#8217;t just for kids and heavy gamers. Anyone with a Foursquare account knows that &#8211; and the stickiness of a badge and a leaderboard. But a good, playful user experience isn&#8217;t about those surface elements either &#8211; it&#8217;s about creating an environment with well-understood rules, meaningful objectives, and a sense of fun. Whether you&#8217;re trying to encourage people &#8211; or yourself &#8211; to save money or to lose weight, a focus on game mechanics and play could be the trump card you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
